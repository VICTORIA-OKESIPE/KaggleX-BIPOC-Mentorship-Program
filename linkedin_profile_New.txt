In terms of skills, I have a passion for creating  Whiteboard animation videos. Whiteboard animation videos are an exciting and innovative way to advertise and market services and products. It can be used to explain and communicate complex ideas. 

Apart from animation, I also typeset math documents, science papers, and presentations using LaTeX. I  can also design  dynamic presentation slides with Beamer using its animation features for slide transitions. In the past few months, I have designed instructional content in Mathematics for elementary and  secondary school students.

I am presently learning and exploring the field of Climate Science and I am looking for opportunities to learn and collaborate in areas related to this field.

I am a recent graduate of the Department of Mathematics at  the  University of Ibadan and currently I am a postgraduate student at the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences (AIMS-CAMEROON). Prior to this, I had a six month internship at the University of Ibadan Laboratory for Interdisciplinary Statistical Analysis (UI-LISA) under the tutelage of Professor O.E.
